Hello! Thank you for choosing to help contribute to this open source library. There are many ways you can contribute and help is always welcome. We simply ask that you follow the following contribution guidelines.

# Feature Request

If you'd like to make a feature request, please read this section.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for library feature requests, but please respect the following restrictions.

- Please search for existing issues in order to ensure we don't have duplicate bugs/feature requests.
- Please be respectful and considerate of others when commenting on issues.

# Report a Bug

**Note:** DO NOT include your credentials in ANY code examples, descriptions, or media you make public.

A software bug is a demonstrable issue in the code base. In order for us to diagnose the issue and respond as quickly as possible, please add as much detail as possible into your bug report.

Before you decide to create a new issue, please try the following:

- Check the GitHub issues tab if the identified issue has already been reported, if so, please add a +1 to the existing post.
- Update to the lastest version of this code and check if the issue has already been fixed

# Style Guidelines & Naming Conventions

Generally, we follow the style guidelines as suggested by the official language. However, we ask that you conform to the styles that already exist in the library. If you wish to deviate, please explain your reasoning.

We have defined the .editorcofig to maintain consistent coding styles. You can use the `dotnet format` tool to lint the code locally.

# Code Reviews

If you can, please look at open PRs and review them. Give feedback and help us merge these PRs much faster! If you don't know how GitHub has some great information on how to review a Pull Request.
